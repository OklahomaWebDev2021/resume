            Ever since the games 688 - attack sub, Gunship 2000, Doom, and
            Ladders came out I have loved being on computers.

            When I found out that I could write games, I wrote versions of space
            invaders, tic tac toe (with AI player), break out (with level
            editor). Funny enough, I programmed these using the database
            language foxpro. The graphics were clunky, but I eventually was able
            to store my settings in a database which was nice, albeit slow.

            I began my computer career at a media company as a data analyst. I
            used excel (programming macros) and foxpro (to generate queries and
            reports). From there, I was hired on with a company to run programs
            to massage data in preparation for the mailing within the postal
            service. I started writing application like an address label
            generating program.

          When I am not glued to a computer monitor, I like to walk and enjoy
          nature. It could be just around the block or at a mesa 50 miles away.
