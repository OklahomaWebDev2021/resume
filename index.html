          My experience has mainly centered around the print industry. I started
          with data analysis and my career culminated with troubleshoot and
          massaging proprietary software code for monthly runs. At a set time
          each month the programmers would either be tasked with running the
          programs or troubleshoot on the fly issues.

          I have had 3 years of college courses. I was in DeVry before they
          started changing things and the degree that I was enrolled in was
          removed and replaced with other degrees.

          I have been in the direct mail industry for over 20 years. I have
          worked for companies such as:
          <ul>
            <li>The Hacker Group, Ltd.</li>
            <li>Fiserv</li>
            <li>Kaye-Smith</li>

            <li>EZ-Access</li>
            <li>OSG (aka Bit, LLC, Diamond Marketing Solutions)</li>

          My primary operating system has been Windows. I have used direct mail
          software such as PostalSoft and database platforms like Foxpro (both
          DOS and Windows). The last two companies that I worked for which was
          EZ-Access and OSG is where I spent the bulk of my time programming.
          While working for EZ-Access, I took Microsoft Access and wrote an
          application to track the time of parts manufacturing workers. It
          tracked time in and out as well as part creation time. It also had
          special screens for administrators to view certain reports and data.
          The last company is were we developed specialized templates that could
          be merged with specific data formats in order to print financial
          statements for hundreds of our clients. We would pick the data
          template and the customize it to meet the data and asthetic needs of
          each individual client.
